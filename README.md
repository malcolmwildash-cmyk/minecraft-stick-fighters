## 🏗️ Hosting & Deployment — read this first (humans + AI agents)

Malcolm's sites span **two different accounts**, which is the easy thing to get wrong:

- **GitHub** — `malcolmwildash-cmyk` (Malcolm's account; **all** source lives here)
- **Vercel** — `travis-9112` / team `travis-9112s-projects` (Travis's account; hosts the Vercel sites)
- **Domain `malcolmwildash.com`** — registrar **and** DNS at **GoDaddy** (Travis's account).
  DNS points the domain at Vercel:
  - `A   @   → 76.76.21.21`
  - `CNAME  www → cname.vercel-dns.com`

### This repo (`minecraft-stick-fighters`)
- **Host:** **GitHub Pages** (no Vercel)
- **Live:** https://malcolmwildash-cmyk.github.io/minecraft-stick-fighters/
- **Deploy:** Served by GitHub Pages from `main`. Push to `main` → Pages redeploys.

### ⚠️ Security — credentials
Never commit tokens or embed them in a git remote URL. A local clone of the
`malcolmwildash.com` repo was set up with an **embedded classic, admin-scoped GitHub
Personal Access Token** in `.git/config`. That token **must be rotated**
(GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens) and git auth should use
the **`gh` CLI credential helper** (`gh auth login`) instead of an embedded token. Do not
paste tokens into code, READMEs, or remote URLs.
